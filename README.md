# Pizza Order System

The pizza menu is listed to the customer and the customer is asked to enter the number of the pizza he prefers in the list. After the customer chooses his pizza, he is asked if he prefers sauce. If he wants a sauce, he is asked to enter the number of the sauces on the menu he prefers. You can choose as much sauce as you want.

After pizza and sauce selections, information such as TR ID number, name, KK number is requested from the customer. After entering the customer information, it is waited for 5 seconds for payment, then the program is terminated with the message of your order successful.

A csv file is created to collect all the information of the customer such as pizza selection, name, tc number, time of order under a file, and this information is saved in the csv file after each order.
